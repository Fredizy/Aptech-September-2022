## How to contribute to a GitHub repository

1. **Fork the Repository**: Just like the owner, you need to fork the repository you want to contribute to. This will create a copy of it on your GitHub account and allow you to make changes without affecting the original source.

2. **Clone the fork**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

3. **Create a branch**: Create a new branch on your local machine where you can make changes using `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.

4. **Make changes, stage, commit and push them**: Make changes to the files in your local machine and stage them for commit using `git add`. Commit the changes using `git commit -m "<commit-message>"`. Push the changes to your forked repository using `git push origin <branch-name>`.

5. **Create a pull request**: Once you have pushed your changes to your forked repository, go back to the original repository and click on "New Pull Request". This will open a new page where you can compare the changes you made with the original repository and create a pull request.
